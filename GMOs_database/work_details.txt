Alterations to the original model

The physical model originally presented required some alterations to promote functionality and to
avoid erros. Therefore, the next alterations were applied:

* The table "artigos", related with the table "espécie modificada" in a ralation of 1:N 
(each specie can have several published papers) was created to allow several bibliographic references
to be added for each specie.

* The ('000') ID was introduced as an atribute for sequences of trangenes not published.

* The relation of the table "sequência" with the table "transgene" was altered to 1:1 to express
that each sequence is unique to each transgene.

* To "ID of transgene" it was added the character 'O' as a suffix in available sequences to maintain
all the IDs uniform, eliminating the variance of "varchars" and "integers".

Functionality Test

In the file 'Test_commands.sql' some commands were executed to test the functionality of the database.
All results were consistent with the objectives, so the database is considered functional.

Challenges in the creation of the Database

The theme of the database is relatively complex with information being limited, so finding examples
to test the database. Therefore, we tried to build the database taking into consideration the possibility
of a lack of information.

The normalization of the database brought some problems in the adaptation of the concept.
The software MySQL Workbench is intuitive, relatively 'user friendly' with several interesting
functionalities for the creation and normalization of the database, as well as in the cleaning of 
all the bugs.
